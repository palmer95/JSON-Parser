Assignment: Project 3

Parsing for each class works.

Main checks that argc is the correct ammount, if so the program continues.

Main.cpp holds the readJSONArray functions for each class.

Each class then reads the data objects and items.

The parsed JSON is then converted into an html string, using the html style given in the example.

I am proud to say that there are no known bugs, and the project was completed in the given time period.
